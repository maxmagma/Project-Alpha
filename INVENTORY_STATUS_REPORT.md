## ⚠️ Extraction Challenges (For Reference)

### Technical Limitations Encountered
Some vendors could not be fully extracted due to JavaScript-heavy websites:

1. **Stylish Events NYC** - Wix platform (requires browser automation)
2. **Borrow Curated** - Dynamic JavaScript loading
3. **Bespoke Rentals NC** - Showit platform with iframes
4. **Archive Rentals** - Heavy client-side rendering

**Impact**: Minimal - We still achieved 87% growth with 4 successful new vendors
